NVM Express® Base Specification, Revision 2.1

499
If a controller supports Directives, then the controller shall:
• Indicate support for Directives in the Optional Admin Command Support (OACS) field  by setting
the DIRS bit to ‘1’ in the Identify Controller data structure;
• Support the Directive Receive command;
• Support the Directive Send command; and
• Support the Identify Directive (i.e., Type 00h).
The Directive Types that may be supported by a controller are defined in Figure 597.
The Directive Specific field and Directive Operation field are dependent on the Directive Type specified in
the command (e.g., Directive Send, Directive Receive, or I/O command).
Figure 597: Directive Types
Directive Directive Type Value Reference I/O Command Directive
Identify 00h 8.1.8.2 No
Streams 01h 8.1.8.3 Yes
Data Placement 02h 8.1.8.4 Yes
Vendor Specific 0Fh  Yes
If a Directive is not supported or is supported and disabled, then all Directive Send commands and Directive
Receive commands with that Directive Type shall be aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in
Command.
Support for a specific Directive Type is indicated using the Return Parameters operation of the Identify
Directive. A specific Directive may be enabled or disabled using the Enable operation of the Identify
Directive. Before using a specific Directive, the host should determine if that Directive is supported and
should enable that Directive using the Identify Directive.
 Directive Use in I/O Commands
I/O Command Directives are the subset of Directive Types that may be used as part of I/O commands. For
example, a Write command in the NVM Command Set may specify a Directive Type and an associated
Directive Specific value. I/O Command Directives shall have a Directive Type value that is less than or
equal to 0Fh due to the size of the Directive Type field in I/O commands. When a Directive Type is specified
in an I/O command, the most significant four bits are assumed to be 0h. A Directive Type of 00h in an  I/O
command specifies that the I/O command is not using Directives.
In an I/O command, if the Directive Type (DTYPE) field is set to an I/O Command Directive, then the
Directive Specific (DSPEC) field includes additional information for the associated I/O command (refer to
Figure 598).
Figure 598: Directive Specific Field Interpretation
Directive Type Value Directive Specific Field Definition
00h (Directives not in use) Field not used.
01h (Streams) Specifies the identifier of the stream associated with the data.
02h (Data Placement)
Specifies the Placement Identifier use d to determine where to write the user data
within non-volatile storage (refer to Figure 282 and Figure 283) of the Endurance
Group associated with the namespace.
03h to 0Eh Reserved
0Fh (Vendor Specific) Vendor specific
In an I/O command:
• if no I/O Command Directive is enabled or the DTYPE field is cleared to 00h, then the DTYPE field
and the DSPEC field are ignored; and
