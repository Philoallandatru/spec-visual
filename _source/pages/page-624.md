NVM Express® Base Specification, Revision 2.1

602
o Indicate support for the Virtualization Management command by setting the VMS bit to ‘1’ in
the Optional Admin Command Support (OACS) field in the Identify Controller data structure;
o The Virtualization Management command;
o The Primary Controller Capabilities Structure defined in Figure 330 (Identify command with
CNS value of 14h);
o The Secondary Controller List defined in Figure 330 (Identify command with CNS value of 15h);
and
o The Namespace Management capability (refer to section 8.1.15);
• One or more secondary controllers; and
• Flexible Resources, each of which supports all of the following:
o Assignment and removal by exactly one primary controller; and
o Assignment to no more than one controller at a time.
Within an NVM subsystem that supports both the Virtualization Enhancements capability and SR-IOV (refer
to section 8.2.6.4), all controllers that are SR -IOV PFs shall be primary controllers, and all controllers that
are SR-IOV VFs shall be secondary controllers of their associated PFs.
 VQ Resource Definition
A Virtual Queue Resource (VQ Resource) is a type of controller resource that manages one CQ and one
SQ. For a VQ Resource that is assigned to a controller, its resource identifier is equivalent to its Queue
Identifier.
The Controller Resource Types field of the Primary Controller Capabilities Structure indicates whether VQ
Resources are supported. If VQ Resources are unsupported, a primary controller and its associated
secondary controllers have all queues as Private Res ources. The rest of this section assumes that VQ
Resources are supported.
The secondary controller is assigned VQ Resources using the Virtualization Management command. The
number of VQ Resources assigned is discoverable in the Secondary Controller List entry for the associated
secondary controller. The number of VQ Resources as signed may also be discovered using the Get
Features command with the Number of Queues Feature identifier (refer to section 5.1.25.2.1).
If a secondary controller has no assigned VQ Resources, then that controller remains in the Offline state.
A secondary controller is not able to transition to the Online state until VQ Resources for an Admin Queue
and one or more I/O Queues have been assig ned to that controller (i.e., the minimum number of VQ
Resources that may be assigned is two).
A primary controller that supports VQ Resources shall have at least two queue pairs that are Private
Resources to ensure there is a minimum of an Admin Queue pair and one I/O queue pair for the primary
controller at all times. A primary controller may be a llocated VQ Resources using the Primary Controller
Flexible Allocation action of the Virtualization Management command. The VQ resources allocated take
effect after a Controller Level Reset and are persistent across power cycles and resets. The number of VQ
Resources currently allocated is discoverable in the Primary Controller Capabilities Structure. The number
of VQ Resources currently allocated may also be discovered using the Get Features command with the
Number of Queues Feature identifier (refer to section 5.1.25.2.1).
 VI Resource Definition
A Virtual Interrupt Resource (VI Resource) is a type of controller resource that manages one interrupt
vector, such as an MSI -X vector. For a VI Resource that is assigned to a controller, its resource identifier
is equivalent to its interrupt vector number.
The Controller Resource Types field of the Primary Controller Capabilities Structure indicates whether VI
Resources are supported. If VI Resources are unsupported, a primary controller and its associated
secondary controllers have all interrupts as Private  Resources. The rest of this section assumes that VI
Resources are supported.
