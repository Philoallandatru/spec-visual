Bytes I/O1 Admin1 Disc1 Description
253 M M M
NVM Subsystem Report (NVMSR):  This field reports information associated with the
NVM subsystem. If the controller is compliant with the NVM Express Management
Interface Specification, then at least one bit in this field is set to ‘1’. If the NVM subsystem
does not support the NVM Express Management Interface Specification , then this field
shall be cleared to 0h. Refer to the NVM Express Management Interface Specification.

Bits Description
7:2 Reserved
1
NVMe Enclosure (NVMEE): If this bit is set to ‘1’, then the NVM subsystem is
part of an NVMe Enclosure. If this bit is cleared to ‘0’, then the NVM subsystem
is not part of an NVMe Enclosure.
0
NVMe Storage Device (NVMESD):  If this bit is set to ‘1’, then the NVM
subsystem is part of an NVMe Storage Device. If this bit is cleared to ‘0’, then
the NVM subsystem is not part of an NVMe Storage Device.
254 M M M
VPD Write Cycle Information (VWCI):  This field indicates information about the
remaining number of times that VPD contents are able to be updated using the VPD Write
command. Refer to the NVM Express Management Interface Specification for details on
VPD contents and the VPD Write command.

Bits Description
7
VPD Write Cycles Remaining Valid (VWCRV): If this bit is set to ‘1’, then the
VPD Write Cycles Remaining field is valid. If this bit is cleared to ‘0’, then the
VPD Write Cycles Remaining field is invalid and cleared to ‘0’.
6:0
VPD Write Cycles Remaining (VWCR):  If the VPD Write Cycle Remaining
Valid bit is set to ‘1’, then this field contains a value indicating the remaining
number of times that VPD contents are able to be updated in units of 256 bytes
using the VPD Write command. For example, a 1 KiB FRU Information Device
that can be updated 8 times would indicate a value of 32 in this field. If this
field is set to 7Fh, then the remaining number of times that VPD contents are
able to be updated using the VPD Write command is greater than or equal to
7Fh.
If the VPD Write Cycle Remaining Valid bit is cleared to ‘0’, then this field is
not valid and shall be cleared to a value of 0h.
255 M M M
Management Endpoint Capabilities (MEC):  This field indicates the support for
Management Endpoints in the NVM subsystem. Refer to the NVM Express Management
Interface Specification for details.

Bits Description
7:2 Reserved
1
PCIe Port Management Endpoint (PCIEME): If the NVM subsystem contains
one or more Management Endpoints on one or more PCIe ports, then this bit
shall be set to ‘1’; otherwise, this bit shall be cleared to ‘0’.
0
2-Wire Port Management Endpoint ( TWPME): If the NVM subsystem
contains one or more Management Endpoints on the 2-Wire port, then this bit
shall be set to ‘1’; otherwise, this bit shall be cleared to ‘0’.
This bit was form erly named SMBus/I2C Port Management Endpoint
(SMBUSME).
Admin Command Set Attributes & Optional Controller Capabilities
257:256 M M R
Optional Admin Command Support (OACS):  This field indicates the optional Admin
commands and features supported by the controller. Refer to section 3.1.3.
